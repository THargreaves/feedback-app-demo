A prototype application for collecting student feedback and proposals in an anonymous fashion with functionality for voting and issue tracking.

Launch the app by running `docker-compose up` from the root of the repository. This will fail the first time since the database will have to initialise so that the app tries to communicate with it before its ready. The second you run it everything should be okay.
